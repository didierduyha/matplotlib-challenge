Module 5 Challenge - matplotlib Challenge

## Description
We are given two .csv files that contain data mouse metadata (ID, weight, etc.) and study results (mouse ID, drug regiment, tumor size, etc.). The code combines these two datasets and looks at both high level summaries of the data (i.e., tumor size statistics, visualization of mice metadata (number of recorded times by treatment, distribution of sex, etc.) to a more in depth summaries (i.e., tumor size distribution for four drug regimens).

## Usage
The script calculates important statistics about tumor sizes by drug regimen and provides visualizations of certain data metrics and metadata. This would provide us an understanding of which antineoplastic drugs are most effective and should be chosen to move forward in drug trials.

## Authors and acknowledgment
This project was completed alone.
